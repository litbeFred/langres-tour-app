## Proposal for Application Optimization

### Overview
This issue proposes the optimization of the `langres-tour-app` application by applying SOLID and KISS principles. 

### Suggestions
1. **Apply SOLID Principles**:  
   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should have one responsibility.  
   - Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.  
   - Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
   - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.  

2. **Apply KISS Principle**: Keep the code as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

3. **Create a Functions Repository**:  
   - Segregate different parts of the application into their own modules. This includes components such as:  
     - Map and Routes  
     - Points  
     - Photos  
     - Virtual GPS  
   - This will allow independent work on each component, improving maintainability and scalability.

### Conclusion
Implementing these principles and creating a functions repository will enhance the structure and efficiency of the `langres-tour-app`.
